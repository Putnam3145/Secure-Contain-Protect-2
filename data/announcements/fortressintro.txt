[TITLE]A Foundation Site[/TITLE]
[P]You have arrived. The O5s decided upon this site
as a new location for containment;
since the CK-class reconstruction event, things have been (by definition) different, and
previous containment sites have been found inadequate given the new information.
[P]There are almost no supplies left,
but you've read the survival manuals. Just follow your directions
and you'll get through this. You've heard
about all of the [VAR:NAME_PLURAL:GLOBAL:LOCAL_LARGE_PREDATOR] around here, but those are just animals.
You have much worse to worry about than animals.
A new tale of the Foundation's efforts begin here at this place, [VAR:NATIVENAME:GLOBAL:YOURFORT], "[VAR:TRANSLATEDNAME:GLOBAL:YOURFORT]". Set up a SCiPNET terminal and get started!
